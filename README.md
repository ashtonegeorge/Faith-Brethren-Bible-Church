# Faith Brethren Bible Church Website

This is the source code for a website I developed for a local church. The website is currently deployed to production at (tbd) and boasts a number of features, such as:
- Anonymous prayer requests via transactional email api
- Audio streaming of sermons
- Customizable content, such as an about page and event calendar, via a headless CMS

## Why was this website developed and deployed to production?

- This church was completely lacking in online presence
- This website serves as a tool to communicate with the congregation and the community
- The web app provides a way for the congregation and others to stream audio content on demand
- The site is marketable to prospective attendees and others who may be interested in the church

## How was this website developed and deployed to production?

- The website was developed using a combination of tools, such as: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Sanity.io CMS](https://www.sanity.io/)
- The website was deployed to production using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and is monitored with Vercel Analytics
- The website is hosted on a custom domain name and is secured with an SSL certificate
- The website is optimized for SEO and is indexed by Google
- The website is optimized with price to performance maximized, as the only associated cost is the domain name

## When was this website developed and deployed to production?

- This website was developed by myself in my free time over my winter break from college, mostly in the evenings and on weekends when I was not working my IT job.
- This website was deployed and demoed to the church secretary on January 26th, 2024 and is in the process of being deployed with a custom domain name.

## Takeaways from the development of this website:
- I had to learn how to create api routes in Next JS to handle the prayer request form submission
- I had to learn various cost effective ways to host the website and deploy it with audio streaming capabilities
- I had to learn how browser caching works in NextJS 13, ensuring the newest content is served on every visit with maximum performance
- I had to learn how to handle page routing in Next JS 13
- I had to learn how to use parameters to dynamically generate pages in Next JS
- I had to learn how to design schema types and query data in Sanity.io CMS using GROQ

## Features / Feature Changes to be added in the future:
- A more robust event calendar with recurring events
- An editorial page for the pastor and others to post articles
- A more content-rich sermon page with a search bar and filtering capabilities
